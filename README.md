FOR TEACHERS: Please refer to PDF version of this document if you can't render markdown in your environment. Thanks.

## Compiliation

This program is written in JDK 8 environments. Since lambda and some other newer JavaFX features have been used, JDK 7 will not work.

If you are using OpenJDK in some Linux distros, please remember to configure JavaFX separately.

You may also need to set cofoja separately before compile. Please refer to [this tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31235078/using-cofoja-annotations-in-intellij) for more information.
